# SoundNotes
This Android app allows the user to write notes enhanced by audio recording.

What it allows to do is to organize audio recordings by writing some text during the recording. An audio recording is associated with a part of the text. For example a student may use it during classes: he creates a new note "Android development #5", start recording, write "Activity life cycle" and some notes, then stop recording when the argument is done, insert a new line, then start recording and write "Fragment life cycle". The two arguments (thus the two recordings) are visually separated.

N.B. The repo is not entirely in English, I'm sorry, this is is one of my first projects.
